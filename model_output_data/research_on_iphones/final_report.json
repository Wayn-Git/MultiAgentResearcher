    "executive_summary": "This research project investigated the environmental and social implications of iPhone production and usage, highlighting challenges such as greenhouse gas emissions, e-waste, and supply chain sustainability concerns. However, labor practices and human rights issues are underrepresented in current research. Identified gaps suggest a need for further investigation into labor practices, individual/community impacts, and political/economic impacts of iPhone production and usage.",
